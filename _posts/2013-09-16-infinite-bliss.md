I've been thinking about [accumulators]({% post_url 2013-09-14-accumulators %}) and
[hedonism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism). If you take hedonism to its logical extreme, then the best possible
thing to do is hook yourself up a pleasure machine that manipulates your brain to feel maximum bliss at all times.

That's what na√Øve hedonism says, but why does that feel so repugnant? Why does that feel so pointless?

It's not enough to say that they are empty because they just tickle the right receptors. You can reduce **all**
experience to fiddling with receptors. That just gets us into jerk off discussions about "what is meaning" and shit like
that.

I think we can keep this more *practical*.

# Infinite Bliss Ends Itself

On a practical level the infinite bliss machine would probably wear off after a while. You'd get used to being
infinitely blissful, and it would feel boring to you. The problem is that infinite bliss is the ceiling. You can
only go down from there. I bet the withdrawals are **brutal**.

{% blog_image bored-bliss.jpg | Ugh, unlimited access to infinite bliss is so stupid. My life is ruined. %}

Said another way: **in comparison to the bliss machine, everything sucks. In comparison to itself, the bliss machine also
sucks.** Follow me:

1.  Your Brain is highly adaptable to input.
2.  If you experience industrial-grade, manufactured bliss pumped into your brain, your brain will get used to it.
3.  When your brain wants more, *there is no "more."*
4.  So you get bored, and you try to stop,
5.  but you find that "actual normal" is *infinitely* worse than "blissful normal."
6.  So even though you are bored with infinite bliss you're locked into it because the alternative is *unbearable*.

**The cycle used to be "boredom, pleasure, ...". Now it's "boredom, agony, ...".**

In effect, our infinite bliss machine is *not* optimally blissful under realistic conditions. That brand of bliss is
actually a local maximum that *limits* total lifetime bliss.

The key to maximizing bliss, then, is to allow for occasional boredom, so that your brain's "bliss baseline" doesn't get
too high for reality to compete.

# The Game of Bliss

So let's ground this talk about infinite bliss machines. When I talk about games like
[Cookie Clicker]({% post_url 2013-09-14-accumulators %}) and I say they are "probably evil", what I'm saying is that
they are the closest thing to an infinite bliss machine that we have. You could argue that some drugs are more
effective, but those effects are universally short lived, and the acclimation takes no time at all.

What I'm saying is that by exploiting the machinery of reward, we are creating a dead end into a local maximum that
could mean a player--an *actual human being*--no longer has the experience of "boredom, pleasure," but instead "boredom,
agony". They will literally have to experience withdrawal and detox to reset their baseline. They may never fully
recover.

# Designing Bliss

This puts game designers in a precarious place similar to tobacco companies. We sell something that people like, and
that we can design to be addictive. It's financially good for us if our players are addicted, but I believe we have a
responsibility to our players not to exploit them in that way. With tobacco it required major government intervention to
achieve any kind of balance. History may see the gaming industry go a similar route.

But even if we collectively decide to deliberately avoid addictive mechanics, we have some hard questions to answer:

1.  **What's the difference between "fun" and "addiction"?**

    When are you smoking because you want to versus because you are addicted?

2.  **How addictive is *too* addictive?**

    Is there a level of addictive potential that's acceptable in service to "fun"? What is that level?

3.  **How can we measure addictive potential?**

    If we know the answers above, what metrics can we use to act on that knowledge?

I'm working on the answers. What do you think?
