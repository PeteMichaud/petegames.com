If I contort the definition of "game" almost unrecognizably, I might call an **Accumulator** a type of game in which the
only mechanic is accumulating some currency. At some point you can use the currency to buy upgrades which allow you to
accumulate currency more quickly.

Accumulators were on my mind after I followed a link to a game called
[CookieClicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) (*warning: industrial-grade addiction*). It's pretty, but
basically you just click the cookie to get 1 cookie. You buy things with cookies that allow you get more cookies. Just
to give you an idea, there is an achievement for accumulating *10 trillion cookies*.

It reminded me of [Ian Bogost's Cow Clicker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_Clicker). Cow Clicker was meant to be a
satirical commentary about the brainless time sinks the Zyngas of the world put out. It was supposed to throw those types
of shallow, addictive mechanics into stark relief, so we as game designers could collectively see the harm we were doing
to our audience and our industry.

But...

# Clicking Cows, who knew?

Instead of triggering high-minded debate about the direction of the industry, **Cow Clicker went viral, and had about
50,000 players in less than two months**.

Wondering about the popularity of these "games" led me to hypothesize about how different [game genres stimulate
different brain regions]({% post_url 2013-09-10-games-on-the-brain %}).

Before I even arrived at that thought, I knew that these games were tapping into a deeply rooted neurochemical reward
system. It's not even targeting the relatively "low" limbic system--this is hitting in the hindbrain like meth hits the
hindbrain.

# Why it Works

Normally I avoid accumulators, but I wanted to answer this question, so I clicked the cookie (a lot). I wanted to know:

1.  **How do players begin the cycle of addiction?**

    Progress is addictive, but how do you get a player to engage with the progress in the first place?

2.  **What is it *about* progress that is addictive?**

3.  **What *breaks* the cycle of addiction once it starts?**

# How to Get a Player Addicted

*   CookieClicker is [juicy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg). That's one aspect of the game that
    engages interest initially, before the player is invested in the score. It's shiny and incomprehensible in the same
    way a cartoon is shiny and incomprehensible to a toddler who is watching.

*   It's easy. There's no skill involved in making the number go up. No learning curve to frustrate you at all--just
    juice to mesmerize you like a minnow swimming too close to an angler fish.

*   It's novel. You visit the page you're not only taken by the visuals, but you're amused at the premise--I have to
    click the cookie to get a cookie? I'll poke it a little. *What's the harm?*

# What makes it addictive?

What I noticed is a cycle that was familiar to me from Diablo and World of WarCraft, both of which I've played, neither
of which I played for very long.

1.  You have this feeling of progress as your cookie count goes up, so that feels good, for a while... but it starts to
    get boring just watching the counter.
2.  You had been generating 10 cookies per second, but now you can afford this thing, whatever it is. That's exciting!
    You know it'll help you, but you don't know how much it'll help you. You've been looking forward to being able to
    find out.
3.  **Holy Shit 100 cookies per second?** Jesus, that's huge. just watching the counter go up is a rush... for a few
    seconds.
4.  You start to get used to 100 cookies per second. It feels normal, boring. You think, eh, I guess I'll stop now, this
    is pointless.
5.  But... I can *almost* afford this other thing. I wonder what that does? I'll just stick around just long enough to
    find out.
6.  Oh, it's ready, that's exciting!
7.  **Holy Fucking Shit 1000 cookies per seconds?** That's crazy! Shit, just a few minutes ago I was only generating 1,
    now I'm at 1000. At this rate I might as well stick around for the next upgrade, it won't take any time at all...

In Diablo you uncover unexplored dungeons which feels good for a while, but then you see an enemy. You're not sure what
loot they'll drop, but you know it'll probably be useful at least to sell. **Holy shit a Stone of Jordan!** Wow, let's
try this thing on, that's really cool!

{% blog_image diablo-accumulator.jpg | I fucking love cookies %}

Then you get used to have the Stone of Jordan, you think about leaving, but... I mean, there's only a little ways left
until the next waypoint. You might as well get there. And, I guess you're almost done with that quest, you might as well
finish that before logging off. Oh, there's another quest. Maybe I should do that one too?
**Holy Shit Godly Plate of the Whale?** I thought that was only for hackers! Damn I'm good.

In psychology we call this **intermittent rewards**. Intermittent rewards are rewards you *sometimes* get for doing a
task. You don't always get them. If you did, then it would be predictable and lose its interest. But if you're not sure
when it's coming... then staying just a little longer couldn't hurt, right?

It's a cycle almost identical to the cycle of abuse: Grooming, Petting, Hitting, Petting, Hitting...

# What can Break the Cycle?

Breaking the cycle is just a matter of breaking the chain of petting and hitting. With abuse petting and hitting is
literal. In games we mean **rewarding** and **boring** the player.

So if we break the chain by stopping rewards, and only supplying predictable boredom, we lose the player, of course.

The interesting thing is that we can also break the chain by stopping boredom with never-ending rewards. Remember,
predictable, reliable rewards are boring. They don't provide the chemical drama that the cycle does.

If I had unlimited cookies to buy whatever I wanted with, I might buy a lot of stuff until the excitement of having the
stuff wore off, then I'd be done; got bored, moved on.

What happened is that pretty far into the game, the upgrades became so expensive that it would take days to
accumulate enough cookies to get even one of them. I got bored and gave up.

# Important Questions

1.  **Are Accumulators exploitative, or do they just deliver what a player obviously wants on some primitive level?**

    My gut says that using this knowledge is potentially "evil" in the "Don't Be Evil" sense. This is a big topic that I
    expanded on in a different article: [Infinite Bliss]({% post_url 2013-09-15-infinite-bliss %}).

2.  **What separates an accumulator from games like Diablo or World of WarCraft?**

    The games use similar mechanisms to accumulators, and I wonder if they aren't just particularly juicy examples of
    accumulation. If there *is* a difference I don't think there's a factor that flips the switch from "legitimate game" to
    "accumulator" (if such a distinction exists). I think it's probably a spectrum that tracks how "accumulator-ish" a game
    is. I talk more about how game designers might deal with that spectrum in
    [Infinite Bliss]({% post_url 2013-09-15-infinite-bliss %}).

# What we can Learn from Accumulators

1.  **Juice** is important, especially during the first impression.

2.  **Novelty** can work as a hook.

3.  Get the player involved in whatever activity is "fun" for your game as **early as possible**. Like in the menu
    screen if possible.

4.  Ramp up the difficulty **very slowly**. Give the player success for doing almost nothing at first, and add
    complexity *just* as they are getting acclimated to the current challenge. There is probably a sweet spot of player
    boredom at which to introduce a new mechanic or challenge.

5.  Don't **ratchet** challenge or reward. As you turn a ratchet, it stops you from turning it back. If you ratchet up
    either challenges or rewards without ever going back to some baseline the game will feel like a slog. Creating a
    boom-bust cycle of reward and boredom will keep a player playing. One of the most powerful tools we have for this is
    **intermittent rewards**.
