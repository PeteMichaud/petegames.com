Wow. First, Blizzard announced that the [Action House is going down forever](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/blog/10974978/).
Ok, so, for those of you who don't know, Diablo 2 was so very popular that it spawned a lot of external auction
services. You could buy gold or gear from these services for actual money. It's something Blizzard fought against on
Battle.Net, but they were never particularly successful at it.

In Diablo 3 they legitimized the practice by creating the official, in-game, Auction House. [This has made a lot of
people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1-the-story-so-far-in-the-beginning-the-universe-was)

It was great in theory: instead of forcing players to either go into the seedy back rooms of the internet or compete on
an uneven playing field, Blizzard made it trivial to trade and sell gear from within the warm womb of the game itself.
If Blizzard makes a little cash on the side by playing middle man, all the better.

Only, not.

# How the Auction House ruined Diablo 3

## Subversion of the Core Game Loop

The Auction House was doomed even if it had been an afterthought tacked onto the clubhouse door like a "no adultz
allowed" sign.

In Diablo 2 the black markets were an issue, but they were a *marginal* issue. Only a few players
relative to the entire corpus of the Diablo 2 fanbase had the time, interest, or ability to find the black market sites
and complete the transactions.

That meant that the black markets had a relatively small effect on the endgame of Diablo 2. In fact, if you wanted to
avoid black market items entirely, you could do that by sticking to your friends and running private games.

The Auction House changed that. Now buying items for cash was *part of the game*. Endgame strategy was inextricably tied
to finding the loot you needed at auction.

Remember: the **whole point** of Diablo, the core game loop, the [dopamine rush]({% post_url 2013-09-14-accumulators %})
of the entire franchise, is combat loot drops. The Auction House literally subverted the *entire point of the game*.
Blizzard undermined the anticipation, the rush of discovery. In fact, they subverted the cycle of addiction they had
tried to create.

So the auction house existing at all ruined at very least the endgame of Diablo 3. But it gets worse.

## Corruption of the Drop Table

Diablo's core loop is the combat loot drop. We've already [learned that to keep players engaged in the boom and bust of
intermittent rewards, we have to maintain the rhythm of boredom and excitement]({% post_url 2013-09-14-accumulators %}).

That means you have to tweak the "drop table" so that the player gets **just enough** awesome loot at any given time. Too
much and the game becomes boring and trivial. Too little and it's a slog without reward like a Sex in the City marathon.

The designers at Blizzard didn't tack on the Auction House like a sign on the door--**they built it into the structure
of the game by tweaking the drop tables to account for it**.

They knew that the Auction House would make great loot too available, so they tweaked the drop rates in an attempt to
keep the supply limited.

Said another way: they made the loot drops worse and less frequent during normal play.

Said another way: **they made it tediously difficult to get decent loot without the Auction House, in effect *requiring*
the player to ruin the core game loop even if she *doesn't want to*.**

# On the other hand...

The core game loop was doubly ruined by the Auction House. We got that.

The whole point of Diablo is grinding for rare loot.

The whole point of Diablo is repetitively and almost mindlessly clicking the screen ad infinitum for in game rewards
that would allow you to gain more in game rewards.

That sounds like one of those [accumulator]({% post_url 2013-09-14-accumulators %}) "games." Maybe it's
[evil]({% post_url 2013-09-16-infinite-bliss %})?

On second thought, maybe they should keep the Auction House in.
