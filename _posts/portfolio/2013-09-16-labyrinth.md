### Goals

This piece tells the story of the only thief who could penetrate the dark Labyrinth to reach
the golden heart in the center. Suitors and brigands alike try, but they are stopped by
thorns and lurking shades. The only one who could pass effortlessly through the bramble, is
the light from the blue Moon.

I wanted to tell the story, but I also wanted a semi-realistic painting that evoked fantasy
without resorting to magical elements per se.

### Process

After I roughed together the composition, I painted the grassy landscape first, then blocked
in the sky. I found a reference photo of very strange turf from Ireland, which I think was
actually some kind of farm, but it struck me that it looked alien. I used that pattern for
the hills to underline the foreign, impossible quality of the landscape. I knew I wanted a
sense of distance, so the background land was put in forced perspective, and I did the tiny
town down below.

I painted this right after the 3D features of Photoshop first came out and I was curious
about using them in the piece, so I decided to model the labyrinth in 3D and import it to
help with perspective. In retrospect I should have just painted it because the texturing
turned out flat if you look closely, and the perspective could have been closer. Also, the
labyrinth is sitting on uneven ground, and trying to modify the model to match the curvature
would've been easier by hand with the tablet. It was worth a shot though!
