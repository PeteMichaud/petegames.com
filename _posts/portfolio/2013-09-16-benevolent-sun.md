### Goals

I'm fascinated by the drama of mythology, and one cross cultural theme is primordial forces
being both creative and destructive. I wanted to render a mythological version of the sun:
the one whose light makes life possible, and the one whose death will eventual wipe us from
the universe.

### Process

The original sketch for this came to me all at once, but was much different than the final
piece. The sun in the sketch was monklike, and slumped over, kindly, but tired. He held the
world like an egg in his outstretched hand.

Not only was the composition not dynamic enough for my tastes, but the destruction of the
world offered very little drama. The breakthrough came when I conceptualized solar flares as
the sun's hair and beard. At that point the compositiion came together nicely, with the blue
explosion extending naturally from the color of the globe.

After the composition was decided, I started by blocking out the face, and the placement of
the Earth, as well as the rough direction of the hair. The original attempt to make the
sun's body ethereal looked strange, so I decided to let the sun's face illuminate an
essentially solid body that would blend in the with the blackness of space.

I built the star field behind him, then applied a motion blur to accentuate the movement of
the blue explosion. Finally, missing a counter balance, I put the viewer on what is probably
the Moon, anchoring and framing the destruction.
