### Goals

We live in a fractal universe which seems to have emerged from infinite regress. The seed
and flower seemed like a powerful metaphor for this iterative process of creation *ex
nihilo*. Could I create a flower that represented all of creation? Could I build it out
of Fractals?

### Process

This was done years ago when I was experimenting with fractal generation. The code is lost
to time.
