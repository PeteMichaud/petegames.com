### Goals

I wanted to explore perception in this piece. How could I make a tree intelligent and caring
without making it a cartoon? How could I bring the texture into stark relief, but make it
murky enough to question the tree's reality? How can I use light to draw attention to danger
and safety?

### Process

Using my WACOM tablet, I built up the background greens from the focal point. I blocked out
the shape of the branches, and decided that to make the tree's texture really palpable, I'd
have to trace a labyrinthine pattern across it by hand. That worked out particularly well
with the moss, where the shadows and highlights give it a nice, pillowy quality.

The farther from the focal point, the more the texture and forms fade into the background,
giving the edges an ominous, surreal quality as the viewer's eye leaves the "safe zone" of
the bright light.

The placement of the background light implies that it's coming from the tree itself, and the
"orbs" nestled among the branches give the tree a magical, living intelligence.
