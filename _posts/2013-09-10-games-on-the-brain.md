I was playing Civilization 5 the other day, when I had an epiphany. I like Civilization because I have time to really
think through what I want to do based on the state of the "board," which is much difference than, say, StarCraft. It's
like untimed Chess in that regard, which is a game I also dig.

But Civ5 and Chess aren't the only games I like. I like fulfilling my adolescent power fantasies as much as the next
Greek embodiment of wanton destruction.

My epiphany was obvious in retrospect. In my work as a coach, sometimes a client comes to me because they want to change
how they feel or stop some bad habit. They have tried all kinds of strategies and incentives but nothing has worked for
them. The reason is that their behavior is rooted in a deeper brain than the one they are targeting.

Say what?

# Brain Anatomy 101

Our brains can be roughly divided into three major sections:

1.  Cerebral Cortex
2.  Limbic System
3.  Hindbrain

That's a gross oversimplification, and there are actually lots of different names for the three sections, and each of
them has important subregions, but I'm going to gloss over all that, and stick with the big three since we're talking
about *video games*, not neurochemistry.

*What I realized is that, just like different therapies, different games target separate regions of the brain.*

## The Regions, Briefly

### Cerebral Cortex

This is our conscious, rational(ish) mind. The part of us that we think of when we think of ourselves. It can do
calculus, plan strategically, and parse language.

### Limbic System

Also known as the *paleomammalian brain*, it's the region of the brain we share with mammals. It's responsible for
emotions mostly, and for physiological addictions and aversions (sort of, again glossing).

It's the reason your dog can get jealous, but he can't do algebra. It's the reason you tell yourself you shouldn't eat
that pizza, but you eat the whole thing anyway. You shit your guts out all night after eating at a skanky Chinese
buffet. Now when you see a chinese place--*any* chinese place--your stomach feels like a bag of smashed assholes.

### Hindbrain

Also know as the *reptile brain*, it's responsible for keeping your heart beating, and making sure you run away from
anything too scary, or kill anything that you can't fuck.

# Brain Genres

My hypothesis is that different games stimulate different regions of the brain, and depending on a player's motivation
for gaming, we can predict what game genres they will enjoy. I also think that maybe if we have a strong grasp of the
reward systems at play in any given genre, we can use that knowledge to craft an experience that is if not better, then
at least more addictive.

***

**Note**: I'm really interested in gaming addiction in general, but I think it's probably unethical to engage in
industrial grade subversion of a player's mental machinery just to get more play time.

***

Finally, I think we could use this knowledge to begin to understand how certain genres might be combined
effectively. We might be able to develop some kind of "periodic table" of game genres, that we can
use to predict "stable" genres that don't yet exist, but that we expect could work.

Basically, it would give us some scientific basis to predict what combinations would probably work well and what
combinations would probably clash.

# Wild Ass Guesses

I want to make some predictions about which genres hit which brain regions:

*   **Neocortex**: Strategy, Puzzle
*   **Limbic**: FPS, Action
*   **Reptile**: Horror, [Accumulator](cookieclicker)

I also want to hypothesize that **we can categorize gamers according to which brain region they are dominantly stimulating
when they play**. Anecdotally, I believe that most gamers are dominant with one region, and have a secondary region as
well.

## Anecdote Inbound

For example I really like storylines in games, and I really like those storylines be to told on the backdrop of pretty
exciting stuff happening. Uncharted comes to mind. That makes me think I'm stimulating my limbic system with the drama
of the story and of the combat. I'm living out a fantasy of animal dominance and success.

I also like First Person Shooters--*but only the single player campaigns*. I don't like playing them online at all. Why
not? The mechanics are identical, right?

The difference is that there's no discovery or revelation in online FPS play, it's more like a sport (which I'm also not
into). You're in arena and you have to make fast paced decisions about what tactic to use, and you do it over and over
until it's in muscle memory.

That doesn't stimulate me, it's too reptilian I think.

On the other hand, I'm not a huge fan of puzzle games. Sitting there tinkering with a game is ok, and I do it sometimes
when I'm bored (Minesweeper!). But that's the thing--boredom. It hits fast, and I move on.

But for me there *is* something to that strategic thinking. One of my favorite games of all time
is Abe's Oddysee, which is a side scrolling platformer... sort of. It's not like Megaman, you don't really fight. It's
more like a puzzle game with exciting graphics. You're an extremely weak character who has to strategically maneuver
around the screens to save your fellow slaves and keep yourself from dying. You don't do that by shooting, you do it by
sitting back and figuring things out then executing the strategy that you carefully figured out. This all happens on the
backdrop of a fun storyline.

With FPSs it's similar -- they are more twitchy than Abe, sure, but guess what my dominant FPS play style is? Stealthy
Sniper. I like to scope things out, plan ahead, get the drop on my enemies. I approach FPSs a little like strategy games,
and if I can't do that, as in most zombie shooters, I'm not interested.

**This anecdote all points in one direction: I'm a limbic-neocortex gamer.** The games I like mostly stimulate the
limbic system, but with a healthy dose of neocortex.

# SCIENCE!

To really find out if I'm right about how different games affect different brain regions we'd need hundreds of gamers
all playing various games hooked up to an fMRI machine. That's probably not going to happen.

{% blog_image science-brain.jpg %}

What I **can** do is run an informal survey of gamers. The selection method (self selection) is bad, but actually kind
of appropriate for this use case, considering that only people who self identify as "gamers" would be interested in
such a survey, and that's who we want. I bet I can get a pretty big sample size as well.

I'm going to try to answer two questions:

1.  **Are the genres people like correlated?**

    For example, if I like FPSs does that mean I'm less likely to enjoy RPGs?

2.  **Do people like genres for similar reasons?**

    Do the people who like RTS games like them for mostly the same reasons?

The first question is easy to get data about, because it's essentially quantitative. The second question is a little
more qualitative. We have to ask people why they like what they like, and then try to find patterns. That's social
science for you though, and we can make it work. I'll explain how I did my analysis when I post the results.

Before I get to the survey itself, I want to pose a few more questions that would be really useful to answer:

1.  Which specific mechanics make a game effective at targeting the reward systems of a given brain region?
2.  In music, certain notes sound harmonious together. What genre combinations mesh well? Under what circumstances?
3.  What genre combinations do not mesh well? Under what circumstances?

# Survey

Please help mankind by filling this survey out. It'll only take a few minutes.

In return you'll get pretty graphs and the satisfaction of being an anonymous data point.
