“playing a game is a voluntary effort to overcome unnecessary obstacles. ”
Bernard Suits, The grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia, 1978
	-this reminds me of drama, where everything should be continuously going wrong,
		stressing out the audience, keeping them riveted like an abusive spouse, with punishment punctuated by honey
		that you know just can't last

If you think something is innovative, it just means you haven ’ t been paying
attention.
Scott Rogers
	"While I am sure there is probably still a completely original idea out there in
     the galaxy of ideas, the majority of gameplay design works by each game
     building upon its predecessor. I truly believe that this strategy is one of the
     keys to creating great game design."





     "Don ’ t forget to ask this important question: “ What is the age of my
     audience? ” Having made dozens of “ kid ’ s ” games, I have observed a useful
     fact about kids and games. Kids always want what is made for an audience
     older than their own age group. For example, an 8 - year- old kid wants to
     play a game that is made for a 10 - year- old kid. A 10 - year- old kid wants
     to play a game that is made for a 13 - year- old kid. A 13 - year- old kid
     wants to play a game that is made for an 18 year old. Many kids aren ’ t
     interested in playing games directly targeting their age range. If asked, they
     will tell you “ that ’ s a game for my little brother. ” Believe me, in kid language,
     there is no greater put down!
     Developers, especially ones who have never made a game for kids before,
     tend to oversimplify and talk down to younger audiences. They say “ we
     don ’ t want this game to be too challenging because it is for kids. ” Don ’ t
     make that mistake."

	Fellowship, Fantasy, Discovery, Narrative, Expression, Challenge, and
	Submission

     “Theory of Un - Fun. ”
     The Theory of Un - Fun states: start with a “ fun ” idea. As you develop the game,
     if you ﬁnd something in the game that is not fun (or un - fun), then remove it.
     When you have removed all of the un - fun, then all that should be left is the fun.
			the problem is keeping objectivity as production wears on

     "An excellent exercise you can use to brainstorm your game idea is to create
      the box and the manual. What would the cover image be? What would the
      bullet points on the back of the box read? How would you communicate the
      game in a black and white, 16 - page manual?"

	Triangle of Weirdness. Choose one, and only one, of the following to be weird in your game:
		Characters, Activities, World

	Ken Levine, director of Bioshock, during 2009 GDC speech:
		When developing a game story, you will ﬁnd there are three different types
        of people in your audience.
        1. Players that are into your story as it happens.
        2. Players that want to get into your story in depth.
        3. Players who don ’ t care what the story is at all

        Solutions:
        • 	 To satisfy players that are looking for a deeper experience, provide
        details but make sure they don ’ t get in the way of the story. For
        example, Bioshock and Batman: Arkham Asylum both have non ­
        mandatory collectable audiotapes that reveal deeper story details
        to the player without intruding in on the main story.
        • 	 Players that are just along for the ride will “ A button ” their way
        through audio cues and cutscenes that reveal story points. Make
        sure your game ’ s story is also revealed through gameplay and
        level design to prevent it being skipped entirely by the player;
        otherwise, the player will get lost and confused5
        . You can also introduce story as gameplay by making them playable ﬂashbacks
        or puzzles.
        • 	 Start your story as late into the action as possible. This can be
        in the middle of a boss ﬁght, at the end of a level, or during
        a car chase. Keep in mind, this works best for games with
        traditional story. I ’ m not sure it ’ s such a good idea to start
        a puzzle game of Tetris with dozens of tiles raining down on
        the player.
        • 	 Always keep your stories lively and moving. Professional screenwriters
        will introduce a change in the plot or action every 15 minutes. Even with
        non - story games, play sessions are becoming “ bite - sized ” so they ’ re
        short enough for players to enjoy in short bursts

	 value of surprise vs suspense from
	 classic director Alfred Hitchcock. Imagine that there are two men sitting at a
	 table talking about baseball. The conversation lasts for about ﬁve minutes,
	 when suddenly, there is a huge explosion! This shocks the audience but
	 that surprise only lasts about 15 seconds.
	 However, here is how you can get a greater impact from your audience.
     Start the scene by showing the bomb under the table. The bomb is set to
     explode in ﬁve minutes. The two men discuss baseball while the audience
     is squirming in their seats thinking “ Don ’ t just sit there talking about
     baseball! There ’ s a bomb under the table! Get out of there! ” By making the
     audience aware of the danger the characters are in, the audience gets
     emotionally involved. By the time your scene reaches its climax, you have
     created more excitement with your audience than just the surprise of the
     bomb exploding

Level 5 - Character, (Camera, Controls)

Rule #1 of Character design: Form follows function

Personality
	Mario: courageous, bouncy, happy
	Sonic: fast, col, edgy
	Kratos: brutal, vicious, selfish

	Kōtiro: passionate, stubborn, (brooding? angry?)

	Let those traits guide your character’s
    creation and everything he does in the game. How does he walk? Fight?
    Open a door? Celebrate? What does he do when he ’ s bored and waiting for
    you to continue playing?

	Walking is NOT gameplay
