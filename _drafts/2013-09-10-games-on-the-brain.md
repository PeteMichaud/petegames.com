Our brains have the neocortex, limbic system, and the hindbrain.

Different types of games appeal to the different levels:

*   Neocortex: strategy, puzzle
*   Limbic: FPS, Action
*   Reptile: Horror, Cookieclicker?

What mechanics make a game effective at targetting the reward systems of a given section of the brain?

What genre combinations are effective at stimulating different parts of the brain?

What genre combinations clash, meaning the gameplay causes conflict between the reward amd punishment
centers of multiple brain regions? Ie an FPS with a puzzle that's too complex takes you away from the
animal rush, into a "boring" stupor.
