1 - Title Page

• 	 Game title
		Game Logos
			When creating your game title for your ten - pager, I suggest
			creating a placeholder logo. Choosing the proper font for your title
			allows you to convey the genre of your game quickly without the need for
			pictures.
• 	 Intended game systems
• 	 Target age of players
• 	 Intended ESRB rating
• 	 Projected ship date.

2 - Game Outline

• 	 Game story summary
	Using your one - sheet ’ s story outline as a starting
	point, ﬂesh out your game ’ s story. Keep in mind, your story outline still
	shouldn ’ t be more than a few paragraphs long; but that shouldn ’ t stop you
	from telling the beginning, middle, and end. Your readers will want to know if
	your hero ever rescues the princess! (He does.)

• 	 Game ﬂow
	Brieﬂy describe the ﬂow of the game ’ s action in the context of
	the locations the player will ﬁnd themselves in. For example: “Tomb Raider:
	Legend is a third person action - adventure that ﬁnds archeologist Lara Croft
	searching the jungles of Bolivia to the mountains of Tibet for the mysterious
	Ghalali key; an artifact which may be the key to ﬁnding Lara ’ s own long lost
	mother. ”
	This brief game ﬂow outline tells the player who they are playing (Lara
	Croft), the camera angle (third person), and genre of gameplay (action ­
	adventure) as well as painting a picture of game locations (Bolivia and
	Tibet) and the player ’ s goals (seek the Ghalali key and solve the mystery
	of Lara ’ s mother).
	Go ahead and list the environments that the player will ﬁnd themselves in.
	Make sure you point out any special gameplay that may occur in these
	locations.
	Other questions that should be answered by the game ﬂow include:
    • 	 What are the challenges the player encounters and the methods by
    which they can overcome them?
    • 	 How does the progression/reward system work? How does the player
    grow as the challenges increase?
    • 	 How does the gameplay tie into the story? Does the player encounter
    puzzles that grant access to new areas when solved? Do players have
    to ﬁght bosses that bar their progression? c04.indd 66 5/12/2010 4:55:57 PM
    66 LEVEL 4 You Can Design a Game, But Can You Do the Paperwork?
     • 	 What is the victory condition for the player? Save the universe? Kill all of
    the enemies? Collect 100 stars? All of the above?

3 - Character

Kōtiro's "personality word" is: passion. She is driven by passion, and everything she
does is informed by her passionate nature.

Idea: Kō, especially at first, isn't particularly skilled at fighting, so her animations
should reflect a shaky defiance and courage, like a small guy who knows he's going to
get his ass kicked, but gives it his all anyway. Maybe big moves should have contact
portion of the move show Kō a little off balance, or the wind up should show her
reaching the edge of her physical strength.

Age, sex, and other “ dossier ” - style background material
can go here … as long as you feel it does your character justice. Don ’ t
go listing your character ’ s blood type if it doesn ’ t add anything to your
game. But if it does, then mention it.
Concept art is a must when dealing with characters. What does your
character look like?
What is the character ’ s backstory? How did they end up in this
predicament? What is their personality type? How do they respond to the
challenges in the game? For example, when I worked on God of War, we
were constantly referring to Kratos as “ brutal ” and everything he did in the
game, from killing enemies to opening treasure chests, had to reﬂect that
personality.
How does all of this information about the character relate back to
gameplay? Does the character have any signature moves, abilities, weapons
or attacks? For example, Mario has his jump and stomp attack while Simon
Belmont from Castlevania has his whip. What other gameplay does the
character do? Driving, ﬂying or swimming? Make sure you allude to every
major style of play in your game

Show a basic map of the character controls. Find an image of the controller
(it ’ s easy to ﬁnd these online) that will be used to play your game, whether
it ’ s a mouse and a keyboard or a Wii Remote, and show where the
controls are going to go

4 - Gameplay

Remember that big list of gameplay genres from Level 3 ? Here is where you
apply those game genres to your game. Start with the gameplay and detail
out how the sequence of play is presented. Are there multiple story
chapters? Or is your game divided up into levels or rounds? Are there any
cool scenarios like driving while shooting or running away from a giant
boulder? Call attention to them. Include your big set pieces, as they will get
your reader interested in your game. Use your USPs from your concept
overview here. Don ’ t forget to outline any minigames, and include a short
description and illustration. Diagrams are a great way to illustrate otherwise
hard - to - imagine gameplay concepts.
Once you have written about your gameplay, go into detail about any
platform - speciﬁc features. What game features capitalize on the platform ’ s
hardware? Does your game utilize a memory card or a hard drive or is it
downloadable? Does it use a camera or a motion controller? Is your
multiplayer mode played split screen? Cover these details because they will
be important for readers to understand what technology requirements will be
needed to produce your game.

5 - Game World

Present some images and descriptions of the game world. List out
environments mentioned in the story. Provide short descriptions that outline
what the player will ﬁnd there. How do these locations tie into your story?
What mood is being invoked in each world? What music will be used? How are all
of the locations connected within the game world as well as for the
player? Include a simple map or ﬂow chart diagram to show how the player
would navigate the world.

6 - Game Experience

What is the gestalt of the game?

How is this feeling going to be presented to the player from the very
beginning of your product? Look to DVD movie menus and packaging
(especially deluxe editions) as inspiration, as they usually do a great job
of capturing the feel of the movie with just a little music, some fonts, and a
few visuals.
Are there any special modes or interfaces for your gameplay? These can be
special modes such as the “ attack copter ” gameplay in Call of Duty 4:
Modern Warfare or Rubi ’ s “ Rage Mode ” in Wet.
Here are a few other important questions about the game ’ s experience you
should answer for the reader of your ten - pager:
• What does the player ﬁrst see when they start the game?
• What emotions/moods are meant to be invoked by your game?
• 	 How is music and sound used to convey your game ’ s feel?
• 	 How does the player navigate the shell of the game? Include a simple
ﬂow chart diagram of how the player would navigate this interface.
(You ’ d be surprised how many games have lousy interfaces because the
team never thought about it!)

7 - Gameplay Mechanics

mechanics
hazards
power ups
collectibles (economy)

8 - Enemies

enemies (hazards that have AI)
bosses - Bosses are different because many of them have
         unique personalities. They are the villains of the story. Who are these boss
         characters? What environments do they appear in? How does the player
         defeat them? What does the player earn for defeating them? Your readers
         will want to know! Boss characters are fun and make for great visuals in
         your document. Show ‘ em off!

9 - Cutscenes

Does your game have movies or cutscenes? How will they be presented to
the player? Describe the method by which they will be created including
(but not limited to) CG, Flash animation, puppet show7
. Describe when the
player will be seeing these — during the game, at the header and footers of
levels, and so on. Make sure to mention any attract mode movies.

10 - Bonus Materials

Hooray! We’ ve reached the last page of our ten - pager! Here ’ s where we
talk about any bonus materials or unlockables that will encourage the player
to replay the game. Give some examples of things the players will be able
to unlock. What is the player ’ s incentive to play your game again? This is
where you would mention things like multiplayer, downloadable content,
episodic content, and so on.

# The Game Design Document (GDD)

Storyboards. Just like movies, gameplay can be storyboarded. It
doesn ’ t matter if you can draw detailed images or stick ﬁgures, there is
truth to the old saying “ a picture is worth a thousand words. ” If you are
having trouble coming up with ideas, you can use published movie
storyboards, comic books, or even the gameplay diagrams in this book
for inspiration.
• 	 Diagrams. If you are worried about your art skills (you shouldn ’ t be;
even a stick ﬁgure conveys information) then you can always diagram
out your gameplay examples. Use consistent shapes and colors to
represent elements of your game. Make sure you include a legend so
readers know what your icons and shapes mean.
• 	 Animatics. Using your storyboards or diagrams as a starting point,
you (or an artist friend) can animate them with programs like PowerPoint
or Flash. While this takes more time, seeing your gameplay examples in
motion leaves very little room for misinterpretation.
• 	 The beat chart. A beat chart is a document that covers the entire span
of the game. The advantage is that it allows readers to grok8
 a lot of
information on one page, and to compare and contrast the ﬂow of
information within the game. Hold on to your horses, cowboy; we will be
talking more about beat charts in a moment.
• 	 The team Wiki. Rather than killing trees, why not publish your GDD
electronically on a Wiki? It ’ s a great way for your team members to be
kept up to date on the latest and greatest game material, especially
since they can contribute to its creation. But be careful; as preproduction
moves into production, a Wiki can very easily become neglected by the
design team and become out of date.
A GDD is ﬁrst and foremost about gameplay. How the character interacts
with the world rather than relates to it; a subtle difference, but an important
difference nonetheless. I ﬁnd bibles important, especially when
communicating your game ’ s universe to other interested parties, but it really
should be done after you have started to ﬂesh out your GDD.
