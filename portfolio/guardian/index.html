                            Conceptual piece of a woman who is safe in the branches of her guardian tree, which bristles
                            with mysterious power, and throbs with ancient benevolence.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Goals</h3>
                        <p>
                            I wanted to explore perception in this piece. How could I make a tree intelligent and caring
                            without making it a cartoon? How could I bring the texture into stark relief, but make it
                            murky enough to question the tree's reality? How can I use light to draw attention to danger
                            and safety?
                        </p>

                        <h3>Process</h3>
                        <p>
                            Using my WACOM tablet, I built up the background greens from the focal point. I blocked out
                            the shape of the branches, and decided that to make the tree's texture really palpable, I'd
                            have to trace a labyrinthine pattern across it by hand. That worked out particularly well
                            with the moss, where the shadows and highlights give it a nice, pillowy quality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The farther from the focal point, the more the texture and forms fade into the background,
                            giving the edges an ominous, surreal quality as the viewer's eye leaves the "safe zone" of
                            the bright light.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The placement of the background light implies that it's coming from the tree itself, and the
                            "orbs" nestled among the branches give the tree a magical, living intelligence.
                        </p>
